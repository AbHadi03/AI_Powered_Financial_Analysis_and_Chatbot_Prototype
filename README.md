# AI-Powered Financial Analysis and Chatbot Prototype

This project involves extracting and analyzing key financial data from 10-K filings of Microsoft, Tesla, and Apple for the last three fiscal years. The project also includes the development of a simplified AI chatbot prototype that responds to predefined financial queries. This was accomplished during an internship with BCG X.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is twofold:
1. **Data Extraction and Analysis**: Manually extract key financial data from 10-K filings of Microsoft, Tesla, and Apple for the last three fiscal years and analyze the data using Python to identify trends and insights.
2. **Chatbot Prototype**: Develop a simplified AI chatbot prototype that can respond to predefined financial queries based on the analyzed data.

- `data_extraction/`: Contains raw 10-K filings and scripts for data extraction.
- `analysis/`: Contains Python scripts for analyzing the extracted data.
- `chatbot/`: Contains scripts and data files for the chatbot prototype.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies for the project.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Data Extraction and Analysis

### Data Extraction

The data extraction phase involves manually collecting key financial data from the 10-K filings of Microsoft, Tesla, and Apple. These filings can be found on the SEC's EDGAR database.

### Analysis

Python scripts are used to analyze the extracted data. The analysis focuses on identifying trends and insights that could inform the development of an AI-powered financial chatbot.

Example analysis includes:
- Revenue trends
- Profit margins
- Expense ratios

## Chatbot Prototype

The chatbot prototype is a simplified version of an AI chatbot for financial analysis. It uses predefined intents and responses to answer basic financial queries. The chatbot is trained using a simple JSON-based intent file.

### Key Components

- `chatbot.py`: The main script to run the chatbot.
- `intents.json`: Contains predefined intents and responses for the chatbot.
- `train_chatbot.py`: Script to train the chatbot.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- nltk

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-financial-chatbot.git
